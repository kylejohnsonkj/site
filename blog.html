                    What the heck guys, how are we already weeks into my junior year of college? Time flies doesn't it... Just wanted to post a small update that I just released a fun little ARKit app on GitHub. Try it out if you have time. Also, our campus has a yearly career conference and it's coming up this next Thursday. Wish me luck, friends! <br>
                    <br>
                    Until next time...

                    <h3>Looking back at an amazing week</h3>
                    <h4>June 26th, 2017</h4>
                    Somehow it has taken me this long to update my blog... No matter, I just wanted to say that my week at WWDC was incredible. Not only did I get to visit California and attend an actual Apple keynote, but I also met some great people along the way which made my experience a worthwhile one (shoutout to Isabel, Marc, Julia and Ryan!). <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm not going to lie. I just typed up a whole blog post about my experience, but it ended up being way too long and all over the place to share. I can't help but feel the collective shame of all my previous writing teachers. To say the least, I created more memories the week of WWDC than I have in a long while. And whenever I feel like I have no motivation, I look at my entry badge and remember what got me there in the first place. <br>
                    <br>
                    As much as I want to go back next year, I hope others who haven't gone get the chance to experience what I did. I'm sure you'll love it just as much as I did!

                    <h3>One more thing...</h3>
                    <h4>April 21st, 2017</h4>
                    I'm excited to say that I have won a scholarship from Apple to attend their Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California! <br>
                    <br>
                    I was chosen as one of 350 winners from around the world to attend the conference free of admission (and lotto). To win a scholarship, I had to create a visually interactive scene within a Swift playground. Entries were judged on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and content of written responses. <br>
                    <br>
                    The conference takes place the week of June 5thâ€”9th and I can't wait to go! I have no idea what to expect, but I'm sure it will be an incredible and motivating experience. I'll try my best to leak you guys some secrets if Tim ends up whispering too loudly.<br>

                    <h4>February 7th, 2017</h4>
                    I'm proud to announce my second iPhone app, and this time, it's a game! <br>
                    <br>
                    At first glance, this game may seem simple. I mean, all you have to do is turn the little bar thingy so that it hits the little ball thingy into the orange target-thingy. WELL GUESS WHAT! You're wrong! Unless you're aiming for a high score of less than 10, then I don't even know what to say. Thanks for downloading, I guess... click on some ads while you're at it. <br>

                    <h3>Shift Timer released</h3>
                    <h4>August 18th, 2016</h4>
                    Guys. I finally released an app! Yes, seriously... <br>
                    <br>
                    Shift Timer allows you to enter your shift hours and get a live-updating view of your progress throughout the day. Ever get bored during one of those long shifts? Just want to know how much time is left to the second? Maybe not, and you're probably quite normal. This app doesn't do much, but it's my first app, and I'm damn proud of it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Check it out on the apps page!

                    It looks like you're trying to know more about me. Would you like some assistance? <br>
                    <br>
                    Yes, that was a Clippy reference. Well anyways, thanks for stopping by! I decided to make a blog because who doesn't want to have their own blog, right? Here I'll ocassionally post things when I release new stuff, as well as at other special times of the year. Hopefully you'll get a feeling for my wacky online persona and use of excessive verbiage.<br>
