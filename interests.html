                        <a href="images/sffpc.jpg" id="alt" target="_blank"><img src="images/sffpc.jpg" class="feature" alt="my small form factor pc"><br>My SFFPC</a>

                I first became interested in building a computer towards the end of college. Over time, I was getting fed up with the poor gaming performance of my MacBook Pro. The one game I did play, Rocket League, had to be run on the lowest settings to get a playable
                framerate. A friend who I played with urged me to start throwing together potential builds, and before I knew it I was addicted.<br><br>I've kept up my interest in building computers since, delving into the niche of "small
                form factor" builds. As my computer was only two years old near the end of 2020, I decided to keep my old components and transfer them into the FormD T1, a small form factor PC case. Moving my build over to this case dropped the total
                volume of my PC from 44L to 9.5L, almost a 5x reduction in size!

                <h3>Rocket League</h3>
                As previously mentioned, I'm a big fan of Rocket League. If you've never played before, imagine soccer, but with flying RC cars instead of players. It's a great pastime that can be played competitively or casually. Teamwork is also a huge part of the
                game and is the key to having the most fun. There's nothing quite like setting up your friends for redirects (fun fact: this happens to be the inspiration for my game "redirect").<br><br>I've taken many breaks from Rocket
                League, but after countless hours, it's the only game that keeps me coming back. Check out this awesome Secret Santa gift I received in 2017!

                <h3>Electric Skateboarding</h3>
                Like many who have delved into this hobby, I was inspired by Casey Neistat's old vlogs in New York City. Somehow he could ride his Boosted Board down the street, flying past cars, and be able to film it at the same time.<br><br>My first
                board was a rather cheap (and sketchy) board, but a couple years later I did purchase a Boosted Mini. More recently though, I've had the desire to ride off-road trails, which is better suited for a different kind of device...
